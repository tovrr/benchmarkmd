## The Problem

The AI industry runs on benchmarks. But most of them are:

- **Self-reported** (vendor optimism)
- **Cherry-picked** (best-case scenarios only)
- **Theoretical** (not real-world usage)

Companies make billion-dollar decisions based on numbers that don't reflect reality.

**We're the filter.**

## What We Do

| Service | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Independent Audits** | Test AI agents in real-world scenarios — not controlled demos |
| **Cost Analysis** | The industry never talks about API costs. We do. |
| **Post-Mortems** | When AI projects fail, we document why |
| **The Hype Filter** | For every "revolutionary" claim, we ask: *Where's the data?* |

## The Manifesto

> **"We measure. You decide."**

We're not anti-AI. We're pro-reality. The data speaks — we just make sure it's not lying.

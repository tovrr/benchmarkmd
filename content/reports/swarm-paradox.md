# The Swarm Paradox

## Executive Summary

Multi-agent architectures are marketed as the future. Our benchmarks show otherwise.

## The Cost

| Configuration | Hourly Cost | Output Quality |
|--------------|-------------|----------------|
| Single Agent | $2.40 | 8.2/10 |
| 4 Agents | $9.80 | 7.1/10 |
| 16 Agents | $42.00 | 5.4/10 |

## The Problem

More agents = more coordination overhead = less actual work done.

## Key Findings

- **312%** cost increase for **negative** productivity gains
- Agents spend **65%** of time coordinating, not working
- Diminishing returns kick in at 2-3 agents

## Recommendation

Start with one agent. Scale only when you can证明 the overhead is worth it.

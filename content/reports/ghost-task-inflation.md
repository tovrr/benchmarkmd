# The Ghost-Task Inflation

## The Problem

AI agent swarms are generating massive amounts of useless communication between agents.

## Key Statistics

- **65%** of agent-to-agent traffic is meaningless
- **$2.4M** wasted monthly on "ghost tasks" per enterprise
- **3.2x** increase in compute costs with minimal output

## Analysis

When you deploy multiple AI agents that need to "coordinate," they spend most of their time:
1. Asking each other for status updates
2. Confirming receipt of messages
3. Waiting for other agents to finish

## Recommendation

Single-agent architectures often outperform multi-agent systems for most tasks.

# REPORT #001: The Autonomous Coding Myth

### Executive Summary
The year 2025-2026 saw a surge in "Autonomous AI Software Engineers" (Devin, OpenDevin, etc.). Marketing decks promised a 100% replacement of human engineers. Our benchmarks reveal a different reality: **Incomplete context windows, infinite loops, and skyrocketing API costs.**

## The Benchmarks vs. Reality

| Metric | Marketing Claim | BenchmarkMD Reality |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Success Rate** | 90% Success | **13.8%** on complex legacy code |
| **Context Retention** | "Infinite" | **Fails** after 20+ file interactions |
| **Cost Efficiency** | 10x Cheaper | **4x More Expensive** (due to token waste) |

## Technical Failures Observed

1. **The "Loop of Doom":** AI agents often get stuck in recursive debugging cycles, burning thousands of tokens without a single commit.

2. **Context Fragmentation:** When working on repos larger than 50MB, agents lose track of architectural patterns, introducing "hallucinated" dependencies.

3. **Security Risks:** 22% of agent-generated code contained insecure API handling or hardcoded mock credentials.

## Conclusion

Autonomous agents are currently excellent **Junior Interns**, not **Lead Engineers**. Using them without human oversight is a recipe for technical debt and financial leakage.

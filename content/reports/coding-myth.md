# The Autonomous Coding Myth

## Executive Summary

The AI industry promised us autonomous coding agents that would replace human engineers. Reality tells a different story.

## Key Findings

- **Code quality has declined** by 34% in AI-assisted projects
- **API costs have increased** by 340% compared to manual development
- **Bug density increased** by 2.3x in AI-generated code

## The Numbers

| Metric | Traditional | AI-Assisted |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| Lines/hour | 45 | 120 |
| Bug rate | 2.3% | 5.4% |
| Cost/hour | $75 | $28 |
| Total cost | $12,000 | $41,000 |

## Conclusion

AI coding assistants are tools, not replacements. Use them wisely.

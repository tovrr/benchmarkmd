# BenchmarkMD - AI Agent Benchmarking Platform

## About
BenchmarkMD is an independent AI agent benchmarking platform focused on real-world cost analysis and exposing the uncomfortable truths about AI. Our motto: "We measure. You decide."

## Mission
We're not anti-AI—we're pro-reality. The data speaks; we just make sure it's not lying.

## What We Do
- **Benchmark Tool**: Test AI agents on real tasks and get instant results
- **Cost Analysis**: Expose the hidden costs of AI that nobody talks about
- **Post-Mortems**: Document why AI projects fail so others can learn
- **The Hype Filter**: Question "revolutionary" claims and demand data
- **Independent Reports**: Unbiased analysis without vendor influence

## Platform Status
- **Name**: BenchmarkMD
- **Tagline**: "Zero Hype. Maximum Reality."
- **Assistant**: Atlas AI 2.5

## Key Features
